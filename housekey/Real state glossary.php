                  <p class="glossary_definition">A record of an individual’s open and fully repaid debts. A credit history helps a lender to determine whether a potential borrower has a history of repaying debts in a timely manner.</p>

                  <h3>Credit Life Insurance</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A type of insurance often bought by mortgagors because it will pay off the mortgage debt if the mortgagor dies while the policy is in force.</p>

                  <h3>Credit Profile</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">There are several ways to ensure you have a good credit report and credit score. One of the most effective is to manage your existing credit in a positive way.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your lender for suggestions about ways to control the amount of money you owe. Or, you can choose a credit counselor from the list provided on this site. Some lenders may view consumers as a greater risk if they have used most or all of their available credit. Consumers who are considered “overextended” may be viewed this way even if they have made all their debt payments on time.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Missing a payment on a bill should be avoided, as should late payments on any of your credit obligations. Experiencing a mortgage foreclosure, filing for bankruptcy, or having your vehicle repossessed can also affect your credit score and credit report, limiting your ability to get new credit at a reasonable rate.</p>

                  <h3>Credit Report</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A report of an individual’s credit history prepared by a credit bureau and used by a lender in determining a loan applicant’s creditworthiness.</p>

                  <h3>Credit Report Fee</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The credit report fee covers the lender’s cost for ordering your credit report from a credit bureau.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This report will verify some of the information you provided on your loan application as well as additional information from the credit agency’s files and from public records.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">When a credit report is received, your lender will check it against your application and look for any discrepancies. You may be asked to explain information in your credit report.</p>

                  <h3>Credit Reporting Agency</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An organization that prepares reports that are used by lenders to determine a potential borrower’s credit history. The agency obtains data for these reports from a credit repository as well as from other sources.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The three main credit reporting agencies, or credit bureaus, are Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union. You can order a copy of your credit report (a nominal fee may apply) via telephone at:</p>

                  <p class="glossary_notes">* Equifax: (800) 685-1111</p>

                  <h3>Credit Repository</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An organization that gathers, records, updates, and stores financial and public records information about the payment records of individuals who are being considered for credit.</p>

                  <h3>Credit Scoring</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your credit score is based on all the information in your credit report. This information is converted into a number - a credit score - that the lender uses to determine whether you are likely to repay your loan in a timely manner. The scores used in mortgage lending are typically in the 300 to 900 range. A general guide is that the higher your score the better. But you should keep in mind that your credit score is just one of several factors that will be used to evaluate your mortgage loan application.</p>

                  <h3>Credit Unions</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A credit union is a financial institution that is owned and run by its members. It is a nonprofit, cooperative institution that offers members a place to save and borrow. A credit union often works by having its members pool their funds so additional loans can be made to other members.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A person to whom money is owed.</p>

                  <h3>Debt</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An amount owed to another. See installment loan and revolving liability.</p>

                  <h3>Deed</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The legal document conveying title to a property.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The deed is the document that transfers ownership from the seller to you. Only the seller signs the deed at closing, and you’ll receive a copy of it.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The closing agent will record the deed with you listed as the new property owner. Your name and the names of any other buyers appear on the deed, and it will be sent to you after it is recorded.</p>

                  <h3>Deed of Trust</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The document used in some states instead of a mortgage; title is conveyed to a trustee.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">In some states, a “deed of trust” is used instead of a mortgage. When homeowners sign a deed of trust, they receive title to the property but convey title to a neutral third party - called a trustee - until the loan balance is paid in full.</p>

                  <h3>Deed-in-Lieu</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A deed given by a mortgagor to the mortgagee to satisfy a debt and avoid foreclosure. Also called a “voluntary conveyance.”</p>

                  <h3>Delinquency</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Failure to make mortgage payments when mortgage payments are due.</p>

                  <h3>Department of Veterans Affairs</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An agency of the federal government that guarantees residential mortgages made to eligible veterans of the military services. The guarantee protects the lender against loss and thus encourages lenders to make mortgages to veterans.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The Veterans Administration is a federal government agency authorized to guarantee loans made to eligible veterans under certain conditions. To obtain more information, you can contact the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The qualification guidelines for VA loans are more flexible than those for either the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or conventional loans.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">If you are a qualified veteran, this can be an attractive mortgage program. To determine whether you are eligible, check with your nearest VA regional office.</p>

                  <h3>Deposit</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A sum of money given to bind the sale of real estate, or a sum of money given to ensure payment or an advance of funds in the processing of a loan.</p>

                  <h3>Depreciation</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A decline in the value of property; the opposite of appreciation.</p>

                  <h3>Detached Single-Family Home</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The most traditional type of single-family home is one that is “detached.” This type of home stands separate from any other housing structure and serves as a place of residence for the occupants.</p>

                  <h3>Direct Leveraging Loan Program</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The Direct Leveraging Loan Program makes it easier and more economical for rural residents to own a home through lower interest rates and no down payment.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Under this program, the lender offers up to 50 percent of the mortgage amount as a conventional 30-year, fixed-rate first mortgage and the Rural Housing Service (RHS) offers the balance as a second mortgage at an interest rate that is generally below market.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The RHS is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>

                  <h3>Discount points</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Discount points are often used to describe a type of fee that lenders charge. Discount points are additional funds you pay the lender at closing to get a lower interest rate on your mortgage.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A point equals 1 percent of the loan amount. So, if you and your lender agree to a mortgage of $100,000, one point would equal $1,000.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Typically, each point you pay for a 30-year loan lowers your interest rate by .125 of a percentage point. If the current interest rate on a 30-year mortgage is 7.75 percent, paying one point would lower the interest rate to 7.625.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your lender if you have the option of paying 1, 2, or 3 discount points - or you can choose not to pay any discount points. It often makes more sense to pay discount points if you plan to stay in your home for a long time.</p>

                  <h3>Dower</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The rights of a widow in the property of her husband at his death.</p>

                  <h3>Down Payment</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The part of the purchase price of a property that the buyer pays in cash and does not finance with a mortgage.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Saving for a down payment is usually one of the most difficult parts of preparing to buy a home. If you believe you have the needed funds, you are in a better position to seek pre-qualification from a lender to get the mortgage that is right for you.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Most homeowners rely on a mortgage from a financial institution, and most mortgage products require buyers to include a portion of their own funds towards the purchase of the home. This is called the down payment. Lenders feel more secure when buyers include a down payment, indicating they are less likely to walk away from their investment if their finances take a downturn.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Historically, buyers usually made a down payment that totaled 20 percent of the home’s purchase price. Under this scenario, a down payment for a $100,000 home is $20,000. But today, new mortgage products allow buyers to put down as little as 3 percent to 5 percent, provided private mortgage insurance is obtained. The down payment for a $100,000 home with 5 percent down payment is just $5,000.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Sources for down payments may come from buyers’ savings accounts, checking accounts, stocks and bonds, life insurance policies, and gifts.</p>

                  <h3>Due-on-sale Provision</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A provision in a mortgage that allows the lender to demand repayment in full if the borrower sells the property that serves as security for the mortgage.</p>

                  <h3>Due-on-transfer Provision</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This terminology is usually used for second mortgages.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_notes">*See also “due-on-sale provision”.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The earnest money is deposited in an escrow account and will be applied to your closing costs.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Sometimes, your lender will want you to bring a receipt for the earnest money deposit along with your sales contract to the initial loan application meeting.</p>

                  <h3>Easement</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A lender determines how much equity you have in your home by taking the appraised value of the home and subtracting any mortgage debt.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">For example, if your house is valued at $150,000 and your mortgage balance is $80,000, you have $70,000 equity in the house.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">If you find errors in your report, follow the directions in the credit report and contact the agencies to have the errors corrected. They will investigate the targeted items and remove incorrect information.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">You don’t have to delay applying for a mortgage while errors in your report are being corrected. Explain the discrepancies in the report to your lender and state that the credit agency is correcting them.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An item of value, money, or documents deposited with a third party to be delivered upon the fulfillment of a condition. For example, the deposit by a borrower with the lender of funds to pay taxes and insurance premiums when they become due, or the deposit of funds or documents with an attorney or escrow agent to be disbursed upon the closing of a sale of real estate.</p>

                  <h3>Escrow Account</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The account in which a mortgage servicer holds the borrower’s escrow payments prior to paying property expenses.</p>

Periodically, an escrow analysis will be performed to determine if current monthly deposits provide sufficient funds to pay bills when they are due.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">With FHA insurance, you can purchase a home with a low down payment from 3 percent to 5 percent of the FHA appraised value or the purchase price, whichever is lower.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">FHA mortgages have a maximum loan limit that varies depending on the average cost of housing in a given region. In general, the loan limit is less than what is available with a mortgage through a lender.</p>

                  <h3>Final Walk-Through Inspection</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your sales contract should include a clause that allows you to examine the property you want to purchase within the 24 hours before closing.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This walk-through, during which you will be accompanied by the real estate sales professional, is your chance to ensure that the seller has vacated the house and left behind whatever property was agreed upon.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Make sure to check that all lights, appliances, and plumbing fixtures are in working order.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">You will also want to make sure that all conditions of the sales contract have been met. If they aren’t, or you observe major problems, you have the right to delay the closing until the problems are corrected.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">One other option is to make sure money to correct the problems is placed in an escrow account at closing to cover the cost of repairs.</p>

                  <h3>Financial Index</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An index is a number to which the interest rate on an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is tied. It is generally a published number expressed as a percentage, such as the average interest rate or yield on U.S. Treasury bills. A margin is added to the index to determine the interest rate that will be charged on ARMs. This interest rate is subject to any caps associated with the mortgage.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The interest rate changes on an ARM are tied to some type of financial index. Some of the most common type of indexed ARMs are:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Treasury-Indexed ARMs</li>
                     <li>CD-Indexed ARMs (Certificate of Deposit)</li>
                     <li>Cost of Funds-Indexed ARMs (COFI)</li>
                     <li>LIBOR-Based ARMs</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">When comparing ARMs, look at how the index to which it is tied has performed recently. Your lender can provide information on how to track the index and a history of the index they use.</p>

                  <h3>Finders Fee</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A fee or commission paid to a mortgage broker for finding a mortgage loan for a prospective borrower.</p>

                  <h3>Firm Commitment</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A lender’s agreement to make a loan to a specific borrower on a specific property.</p>

                  <h3>First Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage that is the primary lien against a property.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A “first mortgage” is the primary lien against a property. The term is usually coined “first mortgage” only when a “second mortgage” is obtained on a property. A “second mortgage” is a lien that is subordinate to the first mortgage. Usually, the interest rates on second mortgages are slightly higher than the interest rates on a first mortgage. The amount of a second mortgage you can take out will depend on the equity you have built up in your home, the appraised value of your property, your credit history, and any other liens you may have against your property, such as a home equity line of credit.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Borrowers will typically get a second mortgage to tap into the equity they’ve built in their home - and use that for home improvements, debt consolidation, medical bills, or other purposes. You apply for a second mortgage with the same process you follow for a first mortgage. However, some of your closing costs may be less.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">When you have a first and second mortgage, you theoretically have two loans, both requiring interest and principal payments.</p>

                  <h3>Fixed Installment</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The monthly payment due on a mortgage loan. The fixed installment includes payment of both principal and interest.</p>

                  <h3>Fixed-Period Adjustable-Rate Mortgages</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This type of adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) maintains the same initial interest rate for the first three, five, seven, or 10 years of your loan, depending on the term you choose. Your interest rate then adjusts annually, and can move up or down as market conditions change. Be sure to ask your lender about the interest rate caps for both the annual adjustments and for the life of the loan.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Your initial interest rate will be lower than a fixed-rate mortgage, so you may be able to afford more home.</li>
                     <li>You are protected against interest rate increases for the first three, five, seven, or 10 years of the loan, depending on which type of fixed-period ARM you choose.</li>
                     <li>You may have the option to convert your ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage at the first, second, or third interest rate adjustment dates.</li>
                     <li>You have time to improve your financial position (i.e. salary increases) or accumulate additional assets before the interest rate adjusts at the end of the fixed period.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Details:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>The lifetime interest rate cap for fixed-period ARMs is typically 5 to 6 percentage points above your initial rate. Your annual cap during the adjustable period is typically 1 to 2 percentage points above or below over the current rate.</li>
                     <li>Can be used to buy one- to four-family residences including second homes and condos, co-ops and planned unit developments. Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent chassis at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Fixed-Rate Mortgage</h3>

                  <p>A mortgage in which the interest rate does not change during the entire term of the loan.</p>

                  <p>Fixed-rate mortgages, the most popular type of mortgage, offer the peace of mind that your interest rate will remain the same for as long as you have your loan. If you expect to live in your home for many years, having the same interest rate may be your key concern. If you decide that you like the stable, predictable payments of a fixed-rate loan, you have the option of choosing from a variety of repayment terms: 15, 20, and 30 years are the most common. Typically, the longer the term of the mortgage, the more interest you pay over the life of your loan. However, stretching out your repayment term means your monthly mortgage payments will be less than they would be with a comparable shorter-term mortgage. Lenders offer a wide array of fixed-rate mortgages:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Balloon Mortgages</li>
                     <li>Biweekly Mortgages</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Fixture</h3>

                  <p>Personal property that becomes real property when attached in a permanent manner to real estate.</p>

                  <h3>Flood Insurance</h3>

                  <p>Insurance that compensates for physical property damage resulting from flooding. It is required for properties located in federally designated flood areas.</p>

                  <h3>Foreclosure</h3>

                  <p>The legal process by which a borrower in default under a mortgage is deprived of his or her interest in the mortgaged property. This usually involves a forced sale of the property at public auction with the proceeds of the sale being applied to the mortgage debt.</p>

                  <p>If you repeatedly do not make your mortgage payments on time, your lender could sell your home and evict you from it in a legal procedure called foreclosure. A foreclosure on your property can result in the loss of your home and your good credit rating. Foreclosure is most often a last resort effort that lenders will take if you repeatedly don’t make your mortgage payments. Before going to foreclosure, lenders will work with you if you are facing financial hardships to come up with repayment plans that will let you get back on track and remain in your home.</p>

                  <h3>Forfeiture</h3>

                  <p>The loss of money, property, rights, or privileges due to a breach of legal obligation.</p>

                  <h3>FSBO (For Sale by Owner)</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">For Sale By Owner, or FSBO, is the process of marketing, buying and selling of real estate without the representation of a real estate broker. FSBO can refer to both the individual selling the property “They are a FSBO,” or the property itself “that house is a FSBO.”</p>

                  <h3>Fully Amortized ARM</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) with a monthly payment that is sufficient to amortize the remaining balance, at the interest accrual rate, over the amortization term.</p>

                  <h3>Good Faith Estimate</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The good-faith estimate is a report from your lender that outlines the costs you will incur to get your mortgage. It is based on the lender’s typical loan origination costs for the area where your home is located. The estimate usually changes between application and closing, so you’ll want to review your settlement form before the closing meeting.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The settlement form will list the actual amount of money you’ll need to bring to closing. You’ll need to pay your closing costs in the form of a certified or cashier’s check because personal checks usually are not accepted.</p>

                  <h3>Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A special type of mortgage that enables older home owners to convert the equity they have in their homes into cash, using a variety of payment options to address their specific financial needs. Unlike traditional home equity loans, a borrower does not qualify on the basis of income but on the value of his or her home. In addition, the loan does not have to be repaid until the borrower no longer occupies the property. Sometimes called a reverse mortgage.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) is a type of home loan that lets homeowners aged 62 or over with little or no remaining balance on their mortgage convert their equity into cash. The equity can be paid to the homeowner in a lump sum, in a stream of payments, draws from a line of credit, or a combination of monthly payments and line of credit.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Whatever payment plan you select, you do not have to repay any part of this reverse mortgage until you sell the home or vacate it for another reason. At that time, you pay the loan balance, plus any accrued interest. Any proceeds above that amount go to you or to your estate.</p>

                  <p>Developed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the HECM mortgage provides a cash growth feature not found with some other reverse mortgages - check with your Fannie Mae approved lender to see how this works based on your personal needs and your payment plan.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>The funds are yours to spend in any way you choose.</li>
                     <li>There are no monthly payments with a HECM.</li>
                     <li>Your loan funds do not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits. (If you receive Supplemental Social Security or Medicaid, these benefits may be affected.)</li>
                     <li>You do not have to pay back the loan until you sell your home or no longer use it for your primary residence. Then, you or your estate will repay the cash you received from the HECM, plus interest and other finance charges to the lender. This means that the remaining equity in your home can be passed on to your heirs through the sale of the property.</li>
                     <li>You will never owe more than the value of the home at the time of repayment, even if the loan balance exceeds the value of your property. This means no debt will ever be passed along to the estate or your heirs.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Details:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>You and any co-borrowers must be at least 62 years old.</li>
                     <li>You must own your home outright - or carry a small mortgage balance.</li>
                     <li>Eligible properties include a single-family home, a two- to four-unit dwelling, a condominium or a manufactured home. All housing types must meet Federal Housing Administration (FHA) guidelines. (Ask your lender if your property qualifies.)</li>
                     <li>Your home must be your principal residence, which means you must live in it more than half the year.</li>
                     <li>You must attend pre-application mortgage counseling before you apply for the loan.</li>
                     <li>You must keep applicable taxes current, as well as maintain insurance coverage on your home.</li>
                     <li>The amount you can borrow with a HECM depends on the age of the youngest borrower(s), the interest rate, how much your house is worth, and the maximum claim amount. In general, you can get between one-third and one-half of your equity as a line of credit or as a lump sum payment.</li>
                     <li>The balance of funds advanced against the equity in your home is due and payable when you relinquish your home as a primary residence, or if the borrower(s) pass away. You may have to pay off the debt if you fail to pay property taxes or insurance or if you do not maintain your property.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage loan, which is usually in a subordinate position, that allows the borrower to obtain multiple advances of the loan proceeds at his or her own discretion, up to an amount that represents a specified percentage of the borrower’s equity in a property.</p>

                  <h3>Home Inspection</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A thorough inspection that evaluates the structural and mechanical condition of a property. A satisfactory home inspection is often included as a contingency by the purchaser. Contrast with appraisal.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The home inspection reviews the structural and mechanical condition of the property. This is not an evaluation of the market value of the home or a determination of whether the home complies with applicable building and safety codes. The inspection does not include a recommendation on whether you should or should not buy the house.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The inspector bases the findings on observable structural elements of the home. Potential home buyers are urged to be present during the inspection - this will allow you to ask questions and be in a better position to learn more about any problems that arise.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">You should expect to see an evaluation of:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>roof and siding,</li>
                     <li>windows and doors,</li>
                     <li>foundation,</li>
                     <li>insulation,</li>
                     <li>ventilation,</li>
                     <li>heating and cooling systems,</li>
                     <li>plumbing and electrical systems,</li>
                     <li>walls, floors, and ceilings,</li>
                     <li>and any common areas if you are purchasing a condominium or cooperative.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">You should view the home inspection report as a way to identify problems before you buy the home, to help negotiate adjustments in the purchase price if problems exist, and to help get the buyer to make any needed improvements before you buy the home.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Lastly - and for some buyers most importantly - the home inspection report is a way to make you feel confident that the home you are buying includes systems that are in good working condition.</p>

                  <h3>Homeowners Association</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A nonprofit association that manages the common areas of a planned unit development (PUD) or condominium project. In a condominium project, it has no ownership interest in the common elements. In a PUD project, it holds title to the common elements.</p>

                  <h3>Homeowners Insurance</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Homeowner’s insurance -- also called “hazard insurance” - should be equal to at least the replacement cost of the property you want to purchase. Replacement cost coverage ensures that your home will be fully rebuilt in case of a total loss.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Most home buyers purchase a homeowner’s insurance policy that includes personal liability insurance in case someone is injured on their property; personal property coverage for loss and damage to personal property due to theft or other events; and dwelling coverage to protect the house against fire, theft, weather damage, and other hazards.</p>

                  <p>If the home you want to buy is located near water, you may be able to get flood insurance as part of your homeowner’s protection. In fact, it may be required in some areas, so check with your real estate professional or an approved lender for further information.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Seek out and compare rates from several insurance companies before making your final decision.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Lenders often want the first year’s premium to be paid at or before closing. Your lender may add the insurance cost to your monthly mortgage payments and keep this portion of your payments in an escrow account. The lender then pays your insurance bill out of escrow when it receives premium notices from your insurance company.</p>

                  <h3>Homeowners Warranty</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A type of insurance that covers repairs to specified parts of a house for a specific period of time. It is provided by the builder or property seller as a condition of the sale.</p>

                  <h3>HomeStyle Construction-to-Permanent Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This mortgage gives you the financial power to build your own home - you can borrow money to build a home from the ground up or to finish building a home that’s currently under construction. This loan provides financing from the construction through the purchase phases of your new home.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>You enjoy peace of mind by locking in fixed interest rates on both the construction and permanent mortgage financing phases of your home purchase in one convenient loan.</li>
                     <li>You can borrow a minimum of 95 percent of the construction cost or the as-completed value of the property (which means your down payment can be as low as 5 percent).</li>
                     <li>You can use this mortgage to purchase land upon which you build your home.</li>
                     <li>You save money because there is one set of closing costs, compared to those associated with separate loans for construction and occupancy.</li>
                     <li>You pay interest only on the funds disbursed during construction.</li>
                     <li>This mortgage can be used for construction that’s already under way.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Details:</p>

                  <ul>

Lenders use the application to evaluate whether or not they can give you a loan, and if so, the amount of money they can lend you. The “four Cs” of credit come into play when filling out an application -- they are capacity, credit history, capital and collateral.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The loan application form requests information such as:</p>

                  <ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Information needed for the loan application may vary from lender to lender, so prior to filling out the application it’s important to discuss with your lender what items your lender will need.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The limit on the size of a mortgage which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase and/or guarantee. The conforming loan limit is set annually by Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s federal regulator, The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). OFHEO uses the October to October percentage increase/decrease in the average house price in the monthly interest rate survey of the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) to adjust the conforming loan limits for the subsequent year.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Mortgages which exceed the conforming loan limit are known as jumbo mortgages. The interest rate on jumbo mortgages can be higher than the interest rate on conforming mortgages. A borrower whose mortgage amount slightly exceeds the conforming loan limit should analyze the economics of reducing their loan size through a larger downpayment or possibly using secondary financing to qualify for a conforming mortgage verses a jumbo mortgage.</p>

                  <h3>Loan Origination</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The process by which a mortgage lender brings into existence a mortgage secured by real property.</p>

                  <h3>Loan Origination Fee</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The loan origination fee covers the administrative costs of processing the loan. It is often expressed in points. One point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">For example, a $100,000 mortgage with a loan origination fee of 1 point would mean you pay $1,000.</p>

                  <h3>Loan Terms and Conditions</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">With a reverse mortgage, a lender can call in your loan under certain conditions. But, if you occupy the property as your primary residence, are not absent from the property for 12 consecutive months.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">You may instruct the lender to pay the taxes and insurance on your behalf from your reverse mortgage funds. The lender will set aside funds from your reverse mortgage to pay for future taxes and insurance, as long as funds are available.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Furthermore, as long as you comply with the terms noted above, you can’t be forced to sell your home to pay off the reverse mortgage, even if the loan balance grows to exceed the value of your property.</p>

                  <h3>Loan-to-Value (LTV) Percentage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The relationship between the principal balance of the mortgage and the appraised value (or sales price if it is lower) of the property. For example, a $100,000 home with an $80,000 mortgage has a LTV percentage of 80 percent.</p>

                  <h3>Lock-In</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A written agreement in which the lender guarantees a specified interest rate if a mortgage goes to closing within a set period of time. The lock-in also usually specifies the number of points to be paid at closing.</p>

                  <h3>Lock-In Period</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The time period during which the lender has guaranteed an interest rate to a borrower.</p>

In effect, it is a “second-level” association that handles matters affecting the entire development, while the “first-level” associations handle matters affecting their particular portions of the project.</p>

                  <h3>Maturity</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The date on which the principal balance of a loan, bond, or other financial instrument becomes due and payable.</p>

                  <h3>Maximum Claim Amount</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your maximum claim amount is the lesser of two figures:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Your home’s appraised value.</li>
                     <li>HUD 203(b) limit.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The HUD 203(b) limit is the maximum loan amount that FHA will insure for residences in your geographical area. Check with your lender to get the latest figures for your area.</p>

                  <h3>Maximum Financing</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage amount that is within 5 percent of the highest loan-to-value (LTV) percentage allowed for a specific product. Thus, maximum financing on a fixed-rate mortgage would be 90 percent or higher, because 95 percent is the maximum allowable LTV percentage for that product.</p>

                  <h3>Merged Credit Report</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A credit report that contains information from three credit repositories. When the report is created, the information is compared for duplicate entries. Any duplicates are combined to provide a summary of a your credit.</p>

                  <h3>Money Market Account</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A savings account that provides bank depositors with many of the advantages of a money market fund. Certain regulatory restrictions apply to the withdrawal of funds from a money market account.</p>

                  <h3>Money Market Fund</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A mutual fund that allows individuals to participate in managed investments in short-term debt securities, such as certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.</p>

                  <h3>Monthly Fixed Installment</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">That portion of the total monthly payment that is applied toward principal and interest. When a mortgage negatively amortizes, the monthly fixed installment does not include any amount for principal reduction.</p>

                  <h3>Monthly Payment Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage that requires payments to reduce the debt once a month.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your monthly mortgage payment is composed of four components.</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Principal refers to the part of the monthly payment that reduces the remaining balance of the mortgage.</li>
                     <li>Interest is the fee charged for borrowing money.</li>
                     <li>Taxes and insurance refer to the amounts that are paid into an escrow account each month for property taxes and mortgage and hazard insurance.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">All four of these elements are often referred to as PITI.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your monthly mortgage payment due may be mailed to you in a book of coupons each year, or in a separate coupon every month.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your lender if the automated underwriting system is used, which may reduce costs associated with your mortgage.</p>

                  <h3>Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A legal document that pledges a property to the lender as security for payment of a debt.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Simply put, the mortgage is the legal document that gives the lender a legal claim against your house should you default on your loan payments. The mortgage indicates that a specific amount of money will be loaned at a specific interest rate so that you can buy your home. Another way of thinking of the mortgage is that you have possession of the property but the lender has ownership until you have repaid your loan.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The items stated in the mortgage include the homeowner’s responsibility to:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>pay principal</li>
                     <li>pay interest</li>
                     <li>pay taxes</li>
                     <li>pay insurance on time</li>
                     <li>pay to maintain hazard insurance on the property</li>
                     <li>adequately maintain the property</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The mortgage also includes the basic information found in the note.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Should you consistently fail to meet these requirements, your lender can seek full repayment of the balance of the loan, foreclose on the property, or sell the property and use the proceeds to pay off the loan balance and foreclosure costs.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A deed of trust is used instead of a mortgage in some states.</p>

                  <h3>Mortgage Banker</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A company that originates mortgages exclusively for resale in the secondary mortgage market.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Mortgage companies originate and service mortgages. In other words, they make loans to consumers. Mortgage companies then typically sell these loans to other lenders and investors.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Some mortgage companies may be subsidiaries of depository institutions or their holding companies but do not receive money from individual depositors.</p>

                  <h3>Mortgage Broker</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An individual or company that brings borrowers and lenders together for the purpose of loan origination. Mortgage brokers typically require a fee or a commission for their services.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The National Association of Mortgage Brokers defines a mortgage broker as “an independent real estate financing professional who specializes in the origination of residential and/or commercial mortgages.”</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">There are an estimated 20,000 mortgage brokerage operations from coast to coast. They originate more than half of the residential loans in the U.S.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage broker has professional expertise that can assist mortgage seekers in finding the best loan for them. The mortgage broker is also experienced in offering many applicable financing options for a consumer’s specific needs.</p>

                  <h3>Mortgage Insurance</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A contract that insures the lender against loss caused by a mortgagor’s default on a government mortgage or conventional mortgage. Mortgage insurance can be issued by a private company or by a government agency such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Depending on the type of mortgage insurance, the insurance may cover a percentage of or virtually all of the mortgage loan.</p>

                  <h3>Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP)</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The amount paid by a mortgagor for mortgage insurance, either to a government agency such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or to a private mortgage insurance (MI) company.</p>

                  <h3>Mortgage Life Insurance</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A type of term life insurance often bought by mortgagors. The amount of coverage decreases as the principal balance declines. In the event that the borrower dies while the policy is in force, the debt is automatically satisfied by insurance proceeds.</p>

                  <h3>Mortgage-Related Closing Costs</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Mortgage-related closing costs generally are costs associated with your loan application. They vary, but here are some of the most common ones:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Loan origination fee: This fee covers the administrative costs of processing the loan. It may be expressed as a percentage of the loan (for example, 1 percent of the mortgage amount).</li>
                     <li>Loan discount points: These points are additional funds you pay the lender at closing to get a lower interest rate on your mortgage. Typically, each point you pay for a 30-year loan lowers your interest rate by .125 of a percentage point. If the current interest rate on a no-point, 30-year mortgage is 7.75 percent, paying one point would lower the interest rate to 7.625. Each point is one percent of the mortgage (for example, if your mortgage is $200,000, one point equals $2,000).</li>
                     <li>Appraisal fee: This fee pays for the appraisal, which the lender uses to determine whether the value of the property secures the loan should you default. The home buyer usually pays this fee. It may appear on the settlement form as “POC,” or “paid outside closing.”</li>
                     <li>Credit report fee: This covers the cost of the credit report, which the lender uses to determine your creditworthiness.</li>
                     <li>Assumption fee: This fee is charged if you take over the payments on the seller’s existing loan. It may range from hundreds of dollars to one percent of the loan amount.</li>
                     <li>Prepaid interest: You are charged interest when you borrow money from a lender, and you will pay interest on the mortgage amount from the date of settlement to the beginning of the period covered by the first monthly mortgage payment. At closing, you may be required to pay in advance the interest for the period.</li>
                     <li>Escrow accounts: Also called reserves, these accounts are required if your lender will be paying your homeowner’s insurance and property taxes. Your lender sets up the escrow account by adding the cost of the insurance and taxes to your monthly mortgage payments. It is kept in reserve until the bills are due. The bills are sent directly to your lender, who makes the payments for you.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Mortgagee</h3>

                  <h3>Multifamily Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A residential mortgage on a dwelling that is designed to house more than four families, such as a high-rise apartment complex.</p>

                  <p><a href="#_">Back to the top</a><br>
                  &nbsp;</p>

                  <h2><a name="_N">N</a></h2>

                  <h3>Negative Amortization</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A gradual increase in mortgage debt that occurs when the monthly payment is not large enough to cover the entire principal and interest due. The amount of the shortfall is added to the remaining balance to create “negative” amortization.</p>

                  <h3>Net Cash Flow</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The income that remains for an investment property after the monthly operating income is reduced by the monthly housing expense, which includes principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI) for the mortgage, homeowners’ association dues, leasehold payments, and subordinate financing payments.</p>

                  <h3>No Cash-Out Refinance</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A refinance transaction in which the new mortgage amount is limited to the sum of the remaining balance of the existing first mortgage, closing costs (including prepaid items), points, the amount required to satisfy any mortgage liens that are more than one year old (if the borrower chooses to satisfy them), and other funds for the borrower’s use (as long as the amount does not exceed 1 percent of the principal amount of the new mortgage).</p>

                  <h3>Non-Liquid Asset</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An asset that cannot easily be converted into cash.</p>

                  <h3>Note</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A legal document that obligates a borrower to repay a mortgage loan at a stated interest rate during a specified period of time.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">One way to think of the mortgage note is that it is a legal “IOU.” Often called the promissory note, it represents your promise to pay the lender according to the agreed upon terms of the loan, including when and where to send your payment.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The note lists any penalties that will be assessed if you don’t make your monthly mortgage payments. It also warns you that the lender can “call” the loan - demand repayment of the entire loan before the end of the term - if you violate the terms of your mortgage.</p>

                  <h3>Note Rate</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The interest rate stated on a mortgage note.</p>

                  <h3>Notice of Default</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A formal written notice to a borrower that a default has occurred and that legal action may be taken.</p>

                  <p><a href="#_">Back to the top</a><br>
                  &nbsp;</p>

                  <h2><a name="_O">O</a></h2>

                  <h3>Occupancy Date</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This provision is a good way to help ensure that your home will be ready for occupancy after the closing takes place. As part of your formal purchase offer, consider including a provision that holds the seller responsible for paying you rent should they not move out on or prior to the agreed-upon date. This allows you, for example, to use the money you receive to pay your own rent if you are leasing your current residence.</p>

                  <h3>Offer</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">When you make an offer on a house, it means you are making a formal bid to buy a home. You can work with your real estate sales professional to put together a written bid that abides by the laws in your state. Your offer should include such aspects as the address of the home, the sales price, the type of mortgage financing you will use to purchase the home, any personal property that might be included as part of the sale, and a target date for closing and occupancy. An earnest money deposit typically accompanies the offer. Your real estate sales professional can provide guidance on other elements of the offer.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Once you have made an offer, the seller has the opportunity to accept, decline, or make a counter-offer. If your offer is accepted, you have a ratified sales contract. This contract is the starting point for working with an approved lender to get the mortgage that’s right for you.</p>

                  <h3>One-Year Adjustable-Rate Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) offers a low initial interest rate with an interest rate that adjusts annually after the first year. The rate cap per annual adjustment is usually 2 percent; the lifetime adjustment caps can be 5 percent or 6 percent. This type of mortgage may be right for you if you anticipate a rapid increase in income over the first few years of your mortgage. That’s because it lets you maximize your purchasing power immediately. It may also be the right mortgage for you if you plan to live in your home for only a few years.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Maximizes your buying power immediately, especially if you expect your income to rise quickly in the next few years.</li>
                     <li>A low first-year interest rate and a 2 percent annual rate cap.</li>
                     <li>Some one-year ARMs let you convert to a fixed-rate loan at certain adjustment intervals.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your approved lender which of their one-year ARMs include this option. Generally, conversions to fixed-rate mortgages are allowed at the third, fourth, or fifth interest rate adjustment dates.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Details:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>You can get a one-year ARM with a term from 10 to 30 years. The most typical ones are 10, 15, or 30 years.</li>
                     <li>The one-year ARM is most often indexed to the weekly average yield of U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year.</li>
                     <li>Can be used to buy one-family, principal residences, including condos, and planned unit developments.</li>
                     <li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent chassis at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Ongoing Costs</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Home buyers should not forget that there are on-going costs associated with owning a home. They include, but are not limited to:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Monthly mortgage payment</li>
                     <li>Mortgage insurance</li>
                     <li>Homeowner’s insurance</li>
                     <li>Property taxes</li>
                     <li>Utilities, such as gas, oil, water and electricity</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Another cost home buyers should consider is how much it will cost to maintain their home. These costs include everything from cleaning and minor repairs to yard work and painting.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Condominium owners and people living in planned unit developments should factor in any homeowners’ association fees or similar costs.</p>

                  <h3>Original Principal Balance</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The total amount of principal owed on a mortgage before any payments are made.</p>

                  <h3>Origination Fee</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A fee paid to a lender for processing a loan application. The origination fee is stated in the form of points. One point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The loan origination fee covers the administrative costs of processing the loan. It is often expressed in points. One point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount. For example, a $100,000 mortgage with a loan origination fee of 1 point would mean you pay $1,000.</p>

                  <h3>Other Buyer Costs</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">There are other costs associated with the closing that are typically paid by the buyer. They often include:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Fees paid to the lender: Loan discount points, loan origination fee, credit report fee, appraisal fee, and assumption fee.</li>
                     <li>Advance payments or prepaid fees: Interest, mortgage insurance premium, and hazard insurance premium.</li>
                     <li>Escrow accounts or reserves: State and local law and lenders’ policies vary but these reserves may have to be set up if the lender will be paying property taxes, mortgage insurance, and hazard insurance.</li>
                     <li>Title charges: Closing (or settlement) fee, title insurance premium, title search, document preparation fees, and attorney fees. The fees the buyer pays for a real estate attorney are not part of settlement procedures.</li>
                     <li>Recording and transfer fees: States often impose a tax on the transfer of property. The payment of a fee for recording the purchasing documents may be required.</li>
                     <li>Additional charges: Surveyor’s fees, termite and other pet infestation inspection fees, and the cost of other inspections required by the lender.</li>
                     <li>Adjustments: Items paid by the seller in advance and items yet to be paid for which the seller is responsible. The most common expense is property taxes, but others may have to be addressed.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Other Contingencies</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A contingency in a contract states that if a certain requirement is not met, the deal can be canceled. Some of the most common contingencies related to home purchases include:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Professional home inspection: This states that your sales contract is contingent on a satisfactory report by a professional home inspector. You have the right not to proceed with the purchase of the home, or to re-negotiate the terms of purchase, if any major problems are uncovered.</li>
                     <li>Termite inspection: This states that the property is free of both visible termite infestation and termite damage.</li>
                     <li>Asbestos: You may choose to hire a qualified professional to inspect the home, take samples for asbestos, and offer solutions to correct any problems.</li>
                     <li>Formaldehyde: This colorless, gas chemical was used in foam insulation for homes until the early 1980s and is emitted by some construction materials. It is suspected of causing cancer, and it can also irritate the throat, nose, and eyes. A qualified inspector can let you know if the gas is present in the home you wish to purchase.</li>
                     <li>Radon: Most home buyers require that the house be tested for radon, a naturally occurring, odorless gas that can cause health problems.</li>
                     <li>Hazardous waste sites: The Environmental Protection Agency has identified contaminated hazardous waste sites across the country. You can contact your EPA regional office for more information.</li>
                     <li>Lead-based paint: You should also have the house inspected for lead-based paint, which can lead to very serious health problems. If the house was built before 1950, you can be fairly certain lead-based paint was used. For houses built between 1950 and 1978, there is also a chance lead-based paint was used. Lead disclosure regulations can vary from state to state. Health officials in the state where the home you want to buy is located may be able to provide further guidance.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The seller or real estate professional must give you a pamphlet that explains lead hazards and tell you about any lead-based paint of which the seller is aware before a sales contract on a home built before 1978 can be finalized. The seller must also allow 10 days during which you can hire a professional to conduct an inspection for lead-based paint hazards.</p>

                  <h3>Other Financial Companies</h3>

                  <h3>Qualifying Guidelines</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">There are two main elements lenders consider when determining whether you and any co-borrowers qualify for a specific mortgage.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The first is your monthly mortgage costs, including mortgage payments, property taxes and insurance. If you’re considering buying a condominium or cooperative, any associated fees are also considered. Your mortgage costs should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly (pre-tax) income.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The second qualifying guideline relates to your total monthly housing costs and other debts you and any co-borrowers have. These costs should not exceed 36 percent of your gross monthly income.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Lenders follow these guidelines because they believe these percentages allow homeowners to pay off their mortgages fairly comfortably without the worry of loan defaults and foreclosures.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">However, these guidelines can be exceeded in certain cases, such as borrowers with a good credit history or with a larger down payment.</p>

                  <h3>Qualifying Ratios</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Calculations that are used in determining whether a borrower can qualify for a mortgage. They consist of two separate calculations: a housing expense as a percent of income ratio and total debt obligations as a percent of income ratio.</p>

                  <h3>Rate Caps</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Lenders offer caps with their adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) so you can have more control over your monthly mortgage payment. Usually, there are two types of rate caps:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>A per-adjustment cap, which specifies the most your interest rate can rise from one adjustment period to the next</li>
                     <li>A lifetime adjustment cap, which specifies how much your interest rate can rise over the life of your loan</li>

                  </ul>

                  <h3>Savings and Loans</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Among the customers of Savings and Loans (S&amp;Ls) are individual savers and residential and commercial property mortgage borrowers. Their traditional role for savings and loans is to accept deposits and make mortgage loans, but it has expanded recently to a focus on one- to four-family residential mortgages, multifamily mortgages and commercial mortgages.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">These institutions are growing bigger, and the lines between S&amp;Ls and commercial banks are not as defined as in the past.</p>

                  <h3>Seller Versus Buyer Closing Costs</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Buyers and sellers often negotiate who will pay certain closing costs, and the results vary depending on the negotiated deal. In fact, it’s not uncommon for a sales agreement to state that either the buyer or seller pays all closing costs. The agreement that you and the seller reach must be specified in the sales contract.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your negotiations could depend on a variety of factors, including the quality of the home, how long the home has been on the market, whether there are any other interested buyers, and how motivated the seller is to sell the home.</p>

                  <h3>Servicer</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An organization that collects principal and interest payments from borrowers and manages borrowers’ escrow accounts. The servicer often services mortgages that have been purchased by an investor in the secondary mortgage market.</p>

                  <h3>Settlement</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The final step before you get the keys to your home is a formal meeting called the closing. It is at this meeting in which ownership of the home is transferred from the seller to the buyer.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Also called a settlement in some parts of the country, the meeting is typically attended by the buyer(s), the seller(s), their attorneys if they have them, both real estate sales professionals, a representative of the lender, and the closing agent. The purpose is to make sure the property is physically and legally ready to be transferred to you.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Several closing costs will be paid at this meeting. These expenses are over and above the price of the property and are incurred when ownership of a property is transferred. Closing costs generally include a loan origination fee, an attorney’s fee, taxes, an amount placed in escrow, and charges for obtaining title insurance, and a survey. Closing costs vary according to the area of the country.</p>

                  <h3>Settlement Sheet</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The HUD-1 Settlement Statement itemizes the amounts to be paid by the buyer and the seller at closing. The (blank) form is published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>

                     <li>loan fees</li>
                     <li>points</li>
                     <li>escrow amounts</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The form is filled out by your closing agent and must be signed by the buyer and the seller. The buyer should be allowed to review the HUD-1 Settlement Statement on the business day before the closing meeting to know the closing costs in advance.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The HUD-1 Settlement Statement is also known as the “closing statement” or “settlement sheet.”</p>

                  <h3>Short Sale</h3>

                  <h3>Six-Month Adjustable-Rate Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) offers a low initial interest rate for the first six months with an interest rate that adjusts every six months thereafter. The rate caps per adjustment can be 1 percent or 2 percent; the lifetime adjustment caps can be 4 percent, 5 percent, or 6 percent. This type of mortgage may be right for you if you anticipate a rapid increase in income over the first few years of your mortgage. That’s because it lets you maximize your purchasing power immediately. It may also be the right mortgage for you if you plan to live in your home for only a few years.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The interest rate is tied to a published financial index. When comparing ARMs that have different indexes, look at how the index has performed recently. Your an approved lender can provide information on how to track a specific index and how to review a 15-year history of the index.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Maximizes your buying power immediately, especially if you expect your income to rise quickly in the next few years.</li>
                     <li>Lets you select an index that meets your financial needs.</li>
                     <li>Easier to qualify for due to a low interest rate and a 1 or 2 percent annual rate cap.</li>
                     <li>Some six-month ARMs let you convert to a fixed-rate loan at certain adjustment intervals. Ask your Fannie Mae approved lender which of their six-month ARMs include this option. Your lender can also provide further specifics about this mortgage option.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Details:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>You can get a six-month ARM with a term of 10 to 30 years. Typically, they are 10, 15, or 30 years.</li>
                     <li>Can be used to buy one- to four-family, owner-occupied principal residences including second homes, investment properties, and condos, co-ops and planned unit developments.</li>
                     <li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent chassis at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Special Deposit Account</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An account that is established for rehabilitation mortgages to hold the funds needed for the rehabilitation work so they can be disbursed from time to time as particular portions of the work are completed.</p>

                  <h3>Standard Payment Calculation</h3>

                  <p>The method used to determine the monthly payment required to repay the remaining balance of a mortgage in substantially equal installments over the remaining term of the mortgage at the current interest rate.</p>

                  <h3>Step-Rate Mortgage</h3>

                  <p>A mortgage that allows for the interest rate to increase according to a specified schedule (i.e. seven years), resulting in increased payments as well. At the end of the specified period, the rate and payments will remain constant for the remainder of the loan.</p>

                  <h3>Subdivision</h3>

                  <p>A housing development that is created by dividing a tract of land into individual lots for sale or lease.</p>

                  <h3>Subordinate Financing</h3>

                  <p>Any mortgage or other lien that has a priority that is lower than that of the first mortgage.</p>

                  <h3>Subprime</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Designating a loan (typically at a greater than usual rate of interest) offered to a borrower who is not qualified for other loans (e.g. because of poor credit history).</p>

                  <h3>Subsidized Second Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An alternative financing option known as the Community Seconds® mortgage for low- and moderate-income households. An investor purchases a first mortgage that has a subsidized second mortgage behind it. The second mortgage may be issued by a state, county, or local housing agency, foundation, or nonprofit corporation. Payment on the second mortgage is often deferred and carries a very low interest rate (or no interest rate). Part of the debt may be forgiven incrementally for each year the buyer remains in the home.</p>

                  <h3>Survey</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A drawing or map showing the precise legal boundaries of a property, the location of improvements, easements, rights of way, encroachments, and other physical features.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your lender may require you to have a survey of the property performed. This process confirms that the property’s boundaries are correctly described in the purchase and sale agreement.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Also called a plot plan, the survey may show a neighbor’s fence is located on the seller’s property or more serious violations may be discovered. These violations must be addressed before the lender will proceed.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The buyer usually pays to have the survey done, but some cost savings may be found by requesting an “update” from the company that previously surveyed the property.</p>

                  <h3>Sweat Equity</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Contribution to the construction or rehabilitation of a property in the form of labor or services rather than cash.</p>

                  <h3>Taxes and Insurance</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">You’ll hear many terms as you work with your mortgage lender, and one of the most frequently mentioned is “PITI.” This abbreviation stands for principal, interest, taxes and insurance.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The tax and insurance components of a mortgage payment are generally held by the lender in an escrow account. The lender pays any property tax and homeowner’s insurance bills as they are due, ensuring they are paid on time.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A home buyer’s monthly mortgage payment generally covers expenses through the escrow account. If you don’t have your homeowner’s insurance and property taxes paid out of a lender escrow account, your local government and your property insurance company will send payment notices directly to you. It is your responsibility to make sure you pay these bills on time.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">If you’re planning to purchase a condominium or cooperative, talk to your lender about how they view condo and co-op fees. Most likely, they are considered housing costs and not a part of PITI. However, this can vary from lender to lender.</p>

                  <h3>Tenancy by the Entirety</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A type of joint tenancy of property that provides right of survivorship and is available only to a husband and wife. Contrast with tenancy in common.</p>

                  <h3>Tenancy in Common</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A type of joint tenancy in a property without right of survivorship. Contrast with tenancy by the entirety and with joint tenacy.</p>

                  <h3>Tenant-Stockholder</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The obligee for a cooperative share loan, who is both a stockholder in a cooperative corporation and a tenant of the unit under a proprietary lease or occupancy agreement.</p>

                  <h3>Termite Inspection</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Homes in many parts of the country must be inspected for termites before they can be sold. You should receive a certificate from a termite inspection firm stating that the property is free of both visible termite infestation and termite damage.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The cost of the termite inspection is usually paid by the seller, and the seller’s real estate sales professional orders the inspection. You need to make sure that the original certificate is delivered to your lender at least three days before closing.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">This allows the lender to review the certificate and address any potential problems.</p>

                  <h3>Third-Party Origination</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A process by which a lender uses another party to completely or partially originate, process, underwrite, close, fund, or package the mortgages it plans to deliver to the secondary mortgage market.</p>

                  <h3>Thrifts</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Thrifts are depository institutions that primarily serve consumers and include both savings banks and savings and loan (S&amp;L) institutions. These institutions originate and service mortgage loans. A thrift may choose to hold a loan in its own portfolio or sell the loan to an investor.</p>

                  <h3>Title</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A legal document evidencing a person’s right to or ownership of a property.</p>

                  <h3>Title Company</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A company that specializes in examining and insuring titles to real estate.</p>

                  <h3>Title Insurance</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Insurance that protects the lender (lender’s policy) or the buyer (owner’s policy) against loss arising from disputes over ownership of a property.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your lender will require that you buy title insurance to ensure that you are receiving a “marketable title”. There are two types of title insurance policies:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Lender’s policy (mandatory): This protects the lender should a flaw in the title be detected after the property has been purchased.</li>
                     <li>Owner’s policy (optional, but recommended): This protects you should a flaw in the title be detected after the property has been purchased.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Generally, the buyer pays the cost of both policies. Check with your insurer, because you may receive a price break if you seek a combined lender/owner policy or if you purchase a “reissue” policy from the company that previously insured the title.</p>

                  <h3>Title Search</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A check of the title records to ensure that the seller is the legal owner of the property and that there are no liens or other claims outstanding.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">In order to make sure the borrower will receive clear title to the property, lenders require a title search. It attempts to uncover any “encumbrances” on the title and makes sure the seller is the actual owner of the property.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Encumbrances include any liens - legal claims against a property filed by creditors as a means to collect unpaid bills. Liens can also be filed by the Internal Revenue Service for nonpayment of taxes. Any such claims must be paid by the seller - this often occurs either before or at the closing.</p>

                  <h3>Total Expense Ratio</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Total obligations as a percentage of gross monthly income. The total expense ratio includes monthly housing expenses plus other monthly debts.</p>

                  <h3>Townhouse</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A townhouse is similar to a condominium in that it’s a type of joint real estate where each housing unit is individually owned. However, it has two or more stories, rather than the typical one floor found in a condominium.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Townhouses are available in many shapes and sizes, and most may have yards or common spaces that can be used by the owners.</p>

                  <h3>Trade Equity</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Equity that results from a property purchaser giving his or her existing property (or an asset other than real estate) as trade as all or part of the down payment for the property that is being purchased.</p>

                  <h3>Transfer of Ownership</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Any means by which the ownership of a property changes hands. Lenders consider all of the following situations to be a transfer of ownership: the purchase of a property “subject to” the mortgage, the assumption of the mortgage debt by the property purchaser, and any exchange of possession of the property under a land sales contract or any other land trust device. In cases in which an inter vivos revocable trust is the borrower, lenders also consider any transfer of a beneficial interest in the trust to be a transfer of ownership.</p>

                  <h3>Transfer Tax</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">State or local tax payable when title passes from one owner to another.</p>

                  <h3>Treasury Index</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">An index that is used to determine interest rate changes for certain adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) plans. It is based on the results of auctions that the U.S. Treasury holds for its Treasury bills and securities or is derived from the U.S. Treasury’s daily yield curve, which is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market.</p>

                  <h3>Trustee</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A fiduciary who holds or controls property for the benefit of another.</p>

                  <h3>Truth-In-Lending</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">A federal law that requires lenders to fully disclose, in writing, the terms and conditions of a mortgage, including the annual percentage rate (APR) and other charges.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Your lender should provide you with the Truth-in-Lending (TIL) Statement within three business days of your loan application. This document outlines the costs of your loan, and it is given to you so you can compare the costs with those of other lenders. Among the costs listed:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>The annual percentage rate (APR), which is the cost of your mortgage compiled as a yearly rate. It may be higher than the interest rate stated in your mortgage because it includes points and other costs of credit.</li>
                     <li>The finance charge.</li>
                     <li>The amount financed.</li>
                     <li>The payment amount.</li>
                     <li>The total payments required.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The lender is required to give you the final version of your TIL Statement at or prior to the closing meeting because it is possible that the APR calculated at your loan application will change at closing.</p>

                  <h3>Two-Step Mortgage</h3>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">The Two-Step Mortgage is a special type of adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) that adjusts only once. Depending on whether you select a five-year or seven-year Two-Step Mortgage, your interest rate will adjust once at the end of either five or seven years. Then, your interest rate stays the same for the remaining 25 or 23 years of your 30-year loan.</p>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>You can qualify with a low starting interest rate. Your initial interest rate is only slightly higher than a balloon loan and is often lower than a 30-year fixed rate loan.</li>
                     <li>You get stable, predictable payments for five or seven years and, after adjustment, for the remaining 25 or 23 years of the loan.</li>
                     <li>You are protected from rising interest rates during the early years of homeownership.</li>
                     <li>You do not have to re-qualify or pay refinance costs at the time the interest rate adjusts.</li>
                     <li>You have time to increase your earnings or accumulate additional assets before the interest rate adjusts at the end of five or seven years.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="glossary_definition">Details:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Your interest rate cap can be no more than 6 percent above your initial interest rate.</li>
                     <li>You can use this mortgage to buy one- to four-family residences including second homes and condos, co-ops and planned unit developments.</li>
                     <li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent chassis at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li>
                  </ul>
