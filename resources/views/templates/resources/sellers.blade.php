                           <h2>Research is worth the effort</h2>
                                      <p>Selling a home involves a lot of steps and can take anywhere from a week to several months—so where do you start?</p>

                           <h3>Find the right listing agent</h3>
                           <br>
                           <hr>
                           <br>
                           <p>First, you should find a local, experienced real estate agent to guide you through the process. Do your research and read reviews to make sure you’re choosing the best person to sell your home.</p>
                           
                           <br>
                           <h3>Get your home ready to sell</h3>
                           <br>
                           <hr>
                           <br>
                           <p>Walk through your home with your agent and note the things that could be updated—cracked windows, leaking pipes, and outdated appliances can quickly turn off potential buyers. Ask your agent to help you decide on the repairs that make sense, and recommend any updates that could help your home sell for more.</p>
                           <p>You may not find a buyer who is willing to pay top dollar for a home with a defective roof. On the other hand, you also can’t guarantee that you will get your money back on remodels, so weigh the costs and the benefits. Instead of a major bathroom remodel, for example, your agent might recommend you add new fixtures and update lighting. </p>

                           <br>
                           <h3>Photograph your home</h3>
                           <br>
                           <hr>
                           <br>
                           <p>Most homebuyers search for homes online first and photos are the first thing they’ll see. Hire a professional photographer to make sure your home leaves a good impression.</p><p>A Nancy EHLEN study shows sellers who use a high-quality camera and lens for their listing photos get thousands of dollars more for their properties. If you choose to work with a Nancy EHLEN Agent, you’ll get professional photos for free.</p>
                           
                           <br>
                           <h3>Pick the right price</h3>
                           <br>
                           <hr>
                           <br>
                           <p>Setting the right price for your home is crucial to the success of the sale. To get an idea of what your home is worth, first check your home’s Nancy EHLEN Estimate. The Nancy EHLEN determines your home’s estimated value based on recent home sales in your area.</p>
                           <p>Your agent will provide you with a comparative market analysis (CMA), which shows the list and final sale prices for comparable homes that recently sold in your area. Based on this, your ideal timeline, and the current market, your agent will help you set a pricing strategy for your home.</p>
                           <br>
                           <h3>When to list your home</h3>
                           <br>
                           <hr>
                           <br>
                           <p>The housing market is hottest in the spring and summer, but speak with your agent about the best listing date for your specific needs. Are you trying to sell the home as quickly as possible? Are you looking to sell for top dollar? Each market is different, and your agent can help you decide on the best timeline for your situation.</p>
                           
                           <br>
                           <h3>Show off your home</h3>
                           <br>
                           <hr>
                           <br>
                           <p>When your home officially hits the market, your agent will put a sign in your yard to attract potential buyers. Now your job is to sit back and let your agent show your home.
                           </p>
                           <p>If you decide to sell with Nancy EHLEN, your listing will also receive premium placement in relevant searches on FeelGreatRealEstate.com, the most-visited real estate brokerage website in the U.S. We’ll also create a customized email campaign for your listing, which means it will show up in the inboxes of homebuyers who are looking for the amenities your home offers.</p>
                           
                           <br>
                           <h3>Review offers</h3>
                           <br>
                           <hr>
                           <br>
                           <p>When it comes time to review offers, your agent will help you choose the best one, or make a counteroffer to ensure you’re maximizing the price and getting the best terms for your situation. Remember, your agent will be your negotiator throughout this process so it’s important to work with an agent you trust.
                           </p>
                           <p>Don’t accept any offers until after the open house or the first weekend of tours. Ask your agent to prepare a spreadsheet outlining the important info from each offer (offer price, down payment, loan amount, etc.). Review this information with your agent and decide whether you want to accept one of the offers or submit a counteroffer.</p>
                           
                           <br>
                           <h3>Complete the closing process</h3>
                           <br>
                           <hr>
                           <br>
                           <p>Once you’ve accepted an offer, it’s time to start the closing process. You’ll work with your agent, lender, and the title or escrow company to ensure a smooth transfer of ownership to the buyer.</p>
                           <P>As the seller, you’ll also pay the real estate commission to both your agent and the buyer’s agent. The typical total commission is 5%–6% with half of the commission paid to the seller’s agent and half to the buyer’s agent.</P>
                           <P>When you work with a Nancy EHLEN you can save thousands in fees. We charge only a 1%–1.5% listing fee to sell your home—without compromising on service.</P>
                           <P>Once you officially close, you’ll receive your money, hand over the keys to the buyer, and celebrate!</P>
